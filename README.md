#### [ ARCHIVED ]

This project has been archived as it is deprecated and incredibly inefficient in comparison to other bots/libraries. I would suggest using [discord-player](https://github.com/Androz2091/discord-player/) by Androz.

# Node.js only discord music bot

#### Overview

Simple music bot, made using only npm modules as a challenge, trying to not use Lavalink. Note that this bot is **not** intended to public use as it doesn't have any proper error handling and command handler.

#### Installation

Download files and fill `.env` file with credentials. To run type `node index.js`
